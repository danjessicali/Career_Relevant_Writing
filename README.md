I am a M.A. student at Columbia University, majoring in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) program (Data Science Track). I completed my undergrad at University of Toronto (statistics and Cognitive Sciences). I am passionate in finding data insights usuing data science and statistics knowledge and willing to share my experience and knowledge.

# Projects

*1. United Nations - Sustainable Developlment Goals Network Linkage Analysis*

Please find the project description [here](https://www.jointsdgfund.org/article/measuring-integration-and-network-effect-sdgs/).

We have created network analysis and NLP analysis for the UN SGDs. UN SGDs has 17 goals, and we selected 15 of them. There are 169 targets and 246 indicators (sub-categories) under the 15 goals.

**Problem**: While the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) are interconnected, current research does not account for this interdependence (Hoff 2011).
**Objective**: Use Social Network Analysis to model evidence-based and measurable linkages between SDG’s at an indicator level. 

**Takeaways**:
- 79-87 of 246 Indicators (32-35% of all indicators) were interconnected by our network models. 
- Different Models -  Different Stories: Text network model does not generalize to the coefficient network.
- Different Countries - Different Connections: When comparing Guatemala and Indonesia, indicator connections did not look very similar 

**Methods**:
- Textual Analysis: We adopted tf-idf word embedding model, which takes into account the frequency of words in their context and within our full text corpus, to analyze the indicators
- Coefficient Models: We used indicator index as the input data. If two indicators change similarly (or inversely) over time, they are more closely interrelated. As ties, we developed correlation coefficients between vectors of year-over-year changes in national-level SDG indicator metrics. 

**Results**:
Text Models aren't similar structurally to coefficient models.
As for the benefits of the project, most importantly, it Provided a network perspective of looking at the SDG indicators and could be used as a tool to a large range of potential users.

*2. U.S. Census Bureau*

TrendR is a multi-functional user dashboard that enables community organizations to visualize changes and trends in data through maps and graphs. It aims to empower community organizations to utilize the potential of publicly available resources to facilitate data-driven decision making.  

Please find the project at [here](https://qmssprogram.shinyapps.io/TrendR_ColumbiaOpportunityProject/).

**Problems**:
TOP Problem Statement: “Develop digital products or physical/digital works of art that enable business, community organizations or local governments to use 2020 Census data for key decision making.” The limited data/analytical ability and skills in community organizations restricts use of publicly-available resources that could help expand impact.

**Results**:
With our multi-functional user dashboard TrendR, we helped to solve the challenge of limited resources for data analytics by incorporating 2 large datasets into our platform, which also solved the constraints of time and budget and lead to a more accessible way to interpret these complex datasets. Besides, our project enables community organizations to visualize changes and trends in data. which empowers them to utilize the potential of publicly available resources to facilitate data-driven decision making such as a more accurate distribution of funds.


**Takeways**:
- Importance of stakeholder involvement in each and every step of the journey; Creating a product they want, and not a product we think they want.
- Simplicity is key; Tech-advanced and complex versus simple and easy to understand.
- Data Science- a field of collaboration; Being open to constructive feedback and learning from others’ experiences. 
- Little drops of water make the mighty ocean; many iterations of the data product create an efficient and effective product.
